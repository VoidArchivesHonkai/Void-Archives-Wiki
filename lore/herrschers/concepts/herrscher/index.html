      <h1><span>Definition</span></h1>
	     <span><span>A Herrscher is a mutated entity which is connected with a Herrscher Core and has the ability to wield the Authority from it.</span></span><br />  
      <h1><span>Previous Era</span></h1>
	     <span><span>A total of 14 variations of Herrscher appeared in the Previous Era. The first 13 Herrschers were opposed and defeated with great costs to humanity, however they were unable to defeat the Final Herrscher leading to the end of the Previous Era.</span></span><br />  
      <h1><span>Current Era</span></h1>
	     <span><span>Due to the interference by the Will of the Honkai, the Herrscher cycle followed the Herrscher variations of the Previous Era with an altered order. Thanks to the new open nature of the Herrscher Cores, Herrschers were able to rebond leading to multiple versions of a Herrscher being able to appear, along with the ability to use the Authority from a different Herrscher Core to create Combo-Herrschers. All Herrschers from the Previous Era with the exception of Binding and Finality appeared in the Current Era.</span></span><br />
