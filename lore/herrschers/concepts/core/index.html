      <h1><span>Definition</span></h1>
	     <span><span>A Herrscher Core is a compressed singularity of Honkai energy given to Herrschers which contain the Herrscher's soul and allows a connected user to tap into the core's Herrscher authority.</span></span><br />  
      <br>
      <h1><span>Previous Era</span></h1>
	     <span><span>14 different variations of cores existed in the previous era, each appeared with their respective Herrscher and were listed in the order of appearance. Due to the cores of the previous era being in an enclosed system the scientists chose to use the cores to make the Devine Keys, weapons made to weild the closed off power of the Herrschers, however the weapons were flawed creations and required lots of time to recharge after use.</span></span><br />  
	  <h1><span>Current Era</span></h1>
	     <span><span>11 different variations of cores existed in the current era, each was listed based the associated Herrscher's number in the previous era. Due to the Will of the Honkai altering the Herrscher cores of the current era to have an open system the cores were able to utalised together to let a single Herrscher tap into the authorities of other cores which led to the creation of combo Herrschers, the open system also meant that the cores could rebond after their host head passed leading to many more Herrschers appearing in the current era compared to the previous era.</span></span><br />
