      <h1><span>Story Summary</span></h1>
	  <p><span><span>Kiana, Mei and Bronya head to New Zealand on a mission to retrieve the Gem of Desire. Upon reaching the location of the Gem it is revealed that it is held within the Valkyrie Wendy who was able to quell its power but at the cost of the functionality of her legs. After the group fights off some Honkai beasts the 4th Herrscher inside Wendy takes control and plans to destroy the Hyperion with everyone on board, running off to achieve the goal. After the groups chase after Wendy a battle ensues which tires out everyone. Anti-Entropy mechs show up and Cocolia once again takes control over Bronya who with help from the mechs knocks out Wendy and Mei to take as test subjects, seeing no reason to keep Kiana, Cocolia uses Bronya to almost kill her but is stopped when they have to retreat due to the Hyperion being too close.</span></span><br />
