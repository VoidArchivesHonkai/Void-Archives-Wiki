      <h1><span>Story Summary</span></h1>
	  <p><span><span>B Rank Valkyrie Kiana Kaslana of St Freya is sent on a mission to capture the Anti-Entropy battleship Selene. After riding on drones and taking out honkai beasts Kiana makes it to the Selene and meets up with fellow B Rank Valkyrie Radien Mei of St Freya, after a fight with some honkai beasts Kiana gets hurt and the 3rd Herrscher takes control of Mei to kill the beasts and save them both. Mei and Kiana then meet up with B Rank Valkyrie Bronya Zaychik of St Freya, together they make their way through the Selene and get to the bridge to take control of it. Bronya hacks the system by using the password of Kiana's birthday to give her full control, however Cocolia remotely activates the control chip in Bronya's head to make her attack Mei and Kiana. After Bronya is battled she regains control of herself and the 3 take the captured Selene back to St Freya with them.</span></span><br />
