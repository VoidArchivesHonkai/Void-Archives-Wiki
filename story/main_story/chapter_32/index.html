      <h1><span>Story Summary</span></h1>
	  <p><span><span>All people on earth are split into 3 groups, the natural stigma awakened (forms), herrshers, and normal people. The forms are sent to a sanctuary on the moon where they would be safe from Project Stigma and could restart society once completion. The Herrschers had restraints put on their powers and were sent to the sea of Quanta where they would be drawn towards a bubble universe created by Finality at the end of the previous era which held a snapshot of the world at the time. The normal people stayed on earth and those who were not under protection against the imaginary started being put into dreams by Project Stigma which would then transform them into data by Hare's power that could then be used for stigmata and merged with the planet. 
The Herrshers would meet up and enter the bubble universe in which they would meet a snapshot of Dr Mei which held her will from before she died. Senti would help Kiana weaken her restraints so she could resync a bridge with that of reality that was buggy due to being in different states, in doing this she is able to connect with Sumaru and speak with Durandal giving both parties the whole story. They would then meet with a form of Prometheus and prepare to return to reality. After some planning Kiana and Mei would enter Kiana's core to find the restraint to destroy it and allow for her to bring them back to the real world. 
After removing the restraints from Kiana they would respawn a defeated husk boss which they would use the imaginary connection from upon death to piggy back back to the imaginary tree resulting in the bubble universe and the main one combining and the bubble world beings returning to their respective counterparts. Prometheus would be saved by Hare who used her data preservation abilities to save her.
