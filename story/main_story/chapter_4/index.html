      <h1><span>Story Summary</span></h1>
	  <p><span><span>Kiana along with A Rank Valkyries Murata Himeko and Theresa Apocalypse travel to the company ME Corp which works with Anti-Entropy and was holding Mei, Bronya and Wendy. After fighting through mechs they hear the voice of Bronya who then helps them break into ME Corp. Once far inside of ME Corp it is revealed that Wendy has been killed and Bronya is still under the control of Cocolia, so she turns on Kiana, Himeko and Theresa. After a battle with Bronya she refused to let Mei get hurt and burned up her bio-chip which Cocolia was using to control her, resulting in her becoming unconscious. While escaping with the unconscious Mei and Bronya the group have to fight the large mech Wotan which is using Wendy's core as a power source. After they all escape they return to St Freya, Mei recovers but Bronya stays unconscious with no one being able to help her, so to help her Theresa enters the underground church below St Freya to find information on biochips.</span></span><br />
