      <h1><span>Story Summary</span></h1>
	  <p><span><span>Theresa searched the computer for information of biochips and entered a virtual space to further search, however Kiana followed her in and got put in a virtual space of Siberia during the 2nd Eruption. While running around Siberia Kiana ran into Theresa who attacks Kiana thinking she is a trick by the 2nd Herrscher as Kiana was only a child at that time. After the battle Kiana is able to convince Theresa that she is indeed Siegfried Kaslana's daughter just not the one she knows and that she is there to help. Theresa now accompanied by Kiana, continues her mission to meet up with Siegfried. The 2 then meet up with Siegfried who reveals that Cecilia has been dispatched giving them a time limit to keep her safe, more information then comes in revealing signs of the 2nd Herrscher in 2 locations. The group once again splits up to go to the locations to deal with the 2nd Herrscher before Cecilia could arrive. Theresa and Kiana only found some Honkai beasts but Siegfried found an initiated combat with the 2nd Herrscher, he attempted to receive support from the others but interference prevented them from giving support. As a last resort Siegfried activated the 0th power of his Devine Key the Judgement of Shamash which engulfed the Herrscher and himself in flames. The Herrscher escaped with injuries and Cecilia arrived to save her husband from his wounds. Kiana and Theresa continued to fight off Honkai beasts to get to the Herrscher until Cecilia arrived and used her Devine Key the Abyss Flower to disintegrate the beast they were struggling with.</span></span><br />
